Playing around with [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) for code swap event.

Ideas

* Dog Wordle (Doggle)
  * Get a random picture of a dog. Try to guess the breed.
  * Enhancements
    * Choose which breeds to guess
    * Parallax to images

do row by row checking
dont show how many letters it is
  give clues/hints on how many letters over/under
  red tiles/ghost tiles
